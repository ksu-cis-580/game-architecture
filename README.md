# GameArchitecture

A starter project for MonoGame games, written for CIS580. It provides the parts every game needs:
menus, rebindable input (including gamepads and shared keyboards), a local multiplayer lobby,
pausing, saved settings, music and sound effects, game-feel effects, and a deterministic
fixed-timestep simulation. The gameplay itself is left for you to write.

Built on MonoGame 3.8.6 (DesktopGL) and .NET 9.

## Quick start

```sh
dotnet build GameArchitecture.slnx                   # build everything, including content
dotnet run --project GameArchitecture                # run the game
dotnet run --project GameArchitecture -- --play      # skip the menus and start playing
dotnet test GameArchitecture.slnx                    # run the tests
```
